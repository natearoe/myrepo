Like any ordination technique, an NMDS is attempting to reduce dimensionality while maintaining relationships between data points.

Introduce dataset
```{r}
dune
dim(dune)
dune.env

```


***Overview of NMDS***
```{r}
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env
```
***Benefits of NMDS:***
- It avoids the assumption of linear relationships among variables
- It allows the use of any distance measure
- Ranked distances useful for community data
Disadvantages:
- Finding local minima
- Computationally intensive 

***Process:*** 
1. Run the NMDS for various dimensions
2. Determine how many dimensions our solution should be (trade-off of    representation and dimensionality)
3. Plot it! 

***Running the NMDS***
So, to begin with, you need to represent the relationship (or distance) between points in the full dimensions. To do this, you use an appropriate distance metric. This is commonly Bray-Curtis for community data. 

```{r}
dune
dune_dist <- vegdist(dune, method = "bray")
dune_dist
```

So, the smaller the value, the more similar the species composition is, because Bray-Curtis shows how different they are relative to how different they could be. A low value means they aren't very different. 

Next, based on these distances, you assign rank order distances - this is why NMDS is non-metric! The closest points are distance one, the second closest are distance 2, etc. 

Then, you reduce the number of dimensions and use an algorithm that trys find a configuration of the plots that maintains those ranked distances. Many iterations of this process are performed (ie. 250), continually trying to find better configurations. The configurations are evaluated by the stress. 

What is stress!? Let's check it out. 

***Running NMDS with solutions from 1 dimension to 6 dimensions***
```{r}
data("dune")

NMDS_dune_1 <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", k = 1, try = 250, autotransform = FALSE)

NMDS_dune_2 <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", k = 2, try = 250, autotransform = FALSE)

NMDS_dune_3 <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", k = 3, try = 250, autotransform = FALSE)

NMDS_dune_4 <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", k = 4, try = 250, autotransform = FALSE)

NMDS_dune_5 <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", k = 5, try = 250, autotransform = FALSE)

NMDS_dune_6 <- metaMDS(dune, distance = "bray", k = 6, try = 250, autotransform = FALSE)

stressplot(NMDS_dune_3)
```
```{r}
dune_stressvector<-as.vector(c(NMDS_dune_1$stress, NMDS_dune_2$stress, NMDS_dune_3$stress, NMDS_dune_4$stress, NMDS_dune_5$stress, NMDS_dune_6$stress))
plot(dune_stressvector)
dune_stressvector
```

Increase dimensionality so long as stress decreases by 0.05 or more
```{r}
dune_stressvector
```


So what is the stress of our solution?
```{r}
NMDS_dune_2$stress
class(NMDS_dune_2)

?metaMDS
str(NMDS_dune_2)
```

Stress evalution:
<.05 - excellent
.05-.10 - good
.10-.20 - usable, potential to mislead at upper end

Let's use the three dimensional solution instead of the 2 because it will be more interesting for visualization


***Adding environmental variables***
```{r}
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env
```


Site scores
```{r}
site.scrs <- as.data.frame(scores(NMDS_dune_3, display = "sites"))
site.scrs <- merge(site.scrs, select(dune.env, Management), by.x = "row.names", by.y = "row.names")
site.scrs

NMDS_dune_3$points
```

Species scores
```{r}
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env
```


```{r}
spp.scrs <- as.data.frame(scores(NMDS_dune_3, display = "species"))
spp.scrs <- cbind(spp.scrs, Species = row.names(spp.scrs))
spp.scrs
```

Environmental vectors
```{r}
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env
```


```{r}
### First, let's relativize the environmental data. We only actually have one numeric environmental variables, so it is not important in this situation, but when you have several environmental variables, it frequently is. Imagine environmental variables whose units are not comparable (ie. pH, depth of soil horizon, canopy cover, etc.). It is particularly important to standardize such values. The vegan function decostand() is really useful for this purpose! 
dune.env

dune_env_num_stand <- decostand(select_if(dune.env, is.numeric), method = "max")

dune_envfit <- envfit(NMDS_dune_3, dune_env_num_stand, choices = 1:3, permutations = 999)
env.scores <- as.data.frame(scores(dune_envfit, display = "vectors"))
env.scores2 <- cbind(env.scores, env.variables = rownames(env.scores), pval = dune_envfit$vectors$pvals)
env.scores2

# NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env
```

***Plotting***

Add sites
```{r}
NMDS_1v2 <- ggplot(site.scrs, aes(x = NMDS1, y = NMDS2)) + geom_point(aes(NMDS1, NMDS2, colour = factor(site.scrs$Management)), size = 4) + labs(colour = "Management type")
NMDS_1v2
```

Add species scores
```{r}
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs <- NMDS_1v2 + ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = spp.scrs, aes(x = NMDS1, y = NMDS2, label = Species), size = 3.0)
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs
```

Add environmental variables
```{r}
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env <- NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs + geom_segment(data = env.scores2, aes(x = 0, xend = NMDS1, y = 0, yend = NMDS2), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")), colour = "grey10", lwd = 0.3) + ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = env.scores2, aes(x = NMDS1, y = NMDS2, label = env.variables), cex = 4, direction = "both", segment.size = 0.25)
NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env

NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env

ggsave("dune_nmds_ggplot.png", plot = NMDS_1v2_spp_scrs_with_env, dpi = 400, height = 9, width = 9)
```

BF = Biological farming
HF = Hobby farming
NM = Nature conservation management
SF = Standard farming

By changing NMDS1 and NMDS2, you can make figures for NMDS1 vs. NMDS3 and NMDS2 vs NMDS3

NMDS axis: 
The interpretation of NMDS ordinations is fundementally different than PCA. The first axis in PCA, by definition, always explains the most variation in the data. The second axis explains the second most variation orthoganal to the first axis. NMDS axis should be treated as meaningless. The number of axis is defined by the user, and the algorithm then attempts to reposition the observations in a way that maintains their ranked distances.  


***vegan3d***
```{r}
my.colors <- brewer.pal(4, "Accent")
par3d(windowRect = c(100, 100, 912, 912))
ordirgl(NMDS_dune_3, size = 4, col = my.colors[as.numeric(dune.env$Management)])
orglspider(NMDS_dune_3, dune.env$Management, col = my.colors[1:4])
orglellipse(NMDS_dune_3, dune.env$Management, col = my.colors[1:4], kind = "se", conf = .95, scaling = "sites")
legend3d("topright", legend = sort(unique(dune.env$Management)), pch = 16, col = my.colors[1:4], inset = c(0.02))
