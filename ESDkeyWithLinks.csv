Shallow Volcanic Tabular Ridges,Y,Y,N,42,"This ecological site is found on south-facing mountain slopes, primarily on the eastern side of Lake Tahoe in the Carson Range, which receives the lowest precipitation in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Elevations are typically between 6,200 and 7,600 feet and slopes are typically between 15 and 50 percent. Soils are moderately deep to deep, or shallow over paralithic granitic bedrock (Cr), and sandy with low available water capacity and nutrients. This exposed, low-water environment supports an open canopy Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) forest with a patchy shrub understory. Greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula) and antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) are the most common shrub species. These coarse soils and exposed sites do not support an extensive herbaceous understory, and forbs and grasses are sparse on this site. "
Stony Shallow Volcanic Hillslopes,Y,Y,N,45,"This ecological site occurs in the highest elevations of the northern subalpine LRU, typically between 9,000 and 10,500 feet on mountain slopes that are typically between 15 and 50 percent. Soils are derived from granitic parent material, and are shallow to moderately deep over paralithic granitic bedrock, with a sandy skeletal particle size class. This site is dominated by whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forest. Cold temperatures and a short growing season restrict the occurrence of less frost resistant conifers. Coarse soils with very low water holding capacity support a minimal understory."
Mesic Volcanic Slopes,Y,Y,N,46,"This ecological site occurs in the highest elevations of the northern subalpine LRU, typically between 9,000 and 10,500 feet on north facing mountain slopes. Slopes are typically between 30 and 50 percent. Soils are derived from granitic parent material, and are moderately deep to very deep over paralithic granitic bedrock, with a sandy skeletal particle size class. The site is characterized by mountain hemlock and whitebark pine forests. Northern aspects retain snow later into the summer, and the additional moisture supports mountain hemlock."
Deep Skeletal North-facing Slopes,N,Y,Y,48,"This site occurs on gentle to steep mountain slopes with moderately to very deep poorly developed gravelly coarse sandy soils over decomposed granite. It occurs at the lower elevations of the subalpine LRU, typically between 7600 and 9000 feet, where soils may have a cryic or frigid temperature regime. Slopes are typically between 15 and 50 percent. The vegetation is mixed upper montane forest, dominated by red fir (Abies magnifica) and western white pine (Pinus monticola). Pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos nevadensis) is common in the canopy openings in the understory. California red fir is a slow-growing, long-lived tree that has high frost tolerance and low drought tolerance, and reaches dominance only in cooler and moister upper elevation. Pinemat manzanita is indicative of cold, dry sites."
Deep Mesic Shoulders and Summits,N,Y,Y,50,"This site occurs on deep sandy skeletal soils, over decomposed granite on north facing slopes and cool, moist basins. It typically occurs at elevations between 7800 and 9000 feet, where snow persists late into the season, and the growing season is short. Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent. The vegetation is mixed subalpine forest, with mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murrayana), red fir (Abies magnifica), and western white pine (Pinus monticola). Understory cover and composition varies with the degree of moisture available at a given location. Purple mountainheath (Phyllodoce breweri) and rose meadowswet (Spiraea splendens) are often abundant, especially in wetter locations."
Mesic Mountain Slopes,N,Y,Y,47,"This site occurs on moderate to steep subalpine, north-facing mountain slopes typically between 7,600 and 9,000 feet. Slopes are typically between 15 and 70 percent. At these high elevations snow persists late into the season, and the growing season is short. Soils are andic, and are moderately deep over paralithic andesitic tuff with medial skeletal textures. Fertile loamy soils support a relatively productive subalpine forest dominated by mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), western white pine (Pinus monticola), Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murrayana) and California red fir (Abies magnifica). The understory is generally sparse with scattered grasses and forbs."
Mesic Ridges and Cool Drainages,N,Y,Y,45,"This site occurs on gently sloping glacial outwash at elevations of approximately 6200 to 6800 feet. Soils are very deep, with a weak fragipan at 12 to 65 inches and redoximorphic concentrations and depletions beginning at 12 inches. Permeability is slow to very slow. The fragipan creates a perched water table, so soils are saturated at shallow depths during the wet season, and droughty during the dry season. This limits the forest canopy to dominance by Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. murrayana), which is tolerant of both saturated and droughty soil conditions. The understory is a sparse cover of native grasses, with squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) the most common species."
Dry Mesic Foothills,N,N,Y,32,"This site occurs on headwater swales and first order streams, often at geologic junctions that create seeps, at elevations typically between 6,000 and 7,800 feet. Slopes are typically between 3 and 15 percent. Soils are very deep, moist, and sandy, and formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed sources. The vegetation is a quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest with a high cover and diversity of forbs and grasses in the understory."
Mesic Steep Convex Slopes,N,N,Y,30,"This ecological site occurs in the highest elevations of the northern subalpine LRU, typically between 9,000 and 10,500 feet on mountain slopes that are typically between 15 and 50 percent. Soils are derived from granitic parent material, and are shallow to moderately deep over paralithic granitic bedrock, with a sandy skeletal particle size class. This site is dominated by whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forest. Cold temperatures and a short growing season restrict the occurrence of less frost resistant conifers. Coarse soils with very low water holding capacity support a minimal understory."
Deep Thermic Hillslopes,N,N,Y,27,"This ecological site occurs in the highest elevations of the northern subalpine LRU, typically between 9,000 and 10,500 feet on north facing mountain slopes. Slopes are typically between 30 and 50 percent. Soils are derived from granitic parent material, and are moderately deep to very deep over paralithic granitic bedrock, with a sandy skeletal particle size class. The site is characterized by mountain hemlock and whitebark pine forests. Northern aspects retain snow later into the summer, and the additional moisture supports mountain hemlock."
Mesic Riparian,N,N,N,28,"This site occurs on gentle to steep mountain slopes with moderately to very deep poorly developed gravelly coarse sandy soils over decomposed granite.
